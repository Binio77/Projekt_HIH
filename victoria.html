            <h2>Victoria III</h2>
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                In the lead up to the game's announcement, Victoria III was seen as a meme by the Paradox fanbase due to players constantly asking about it, only to be ignored, with many joking that it would never see a release or that any mention of the number 'three' from an official Paradox source meant that the game was on the way.

                Martin "Wiz" Anward served as director of the game's development. In April 2022, a beta version of the game was leaked online.

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>
                Victoria III spans world history from 1836 to 1936 and allows the player to control any one of over 100 countries that existed during that time period.

                The game focuses on politics and demographics, with gameplay focusing on appealing to and appeasing population groups ("pops"), large blocks of people with shared interests. Pops possess a variety of interests with different ideologies that the player deals with.

                Another system in the game is Diplomatic Plays, which borrows heavily from Victoria II's crisis system. When attempting to force other countries to concede land or open markets, players will present a target country with a demand detailing what they desire, which will result in the target country having the opportunity to demand concessions from the aggressor. Following this exchange of demands, a timer will begin counting down as both sides have a chance to mobilize troops and attract potential allies by offering spoils. If no diplomatic resolution is reached before the timer runs out, war will be declared. Designer Mikael Andersson explained that this system was designed with the intent to tone down the role of warfare by making diplomacy equally as capable.[
